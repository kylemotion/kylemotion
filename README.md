ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Kyle!

I'm a 2D motion designer who's currently obsessed with combining all things motion with code and automation.

Currently I find myself being in a mix of the following at any given moment:
ðŸ”¨ Building After Effects workflow tools
ðŸ“š Learning object-oriented programming
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding a gulp-centric workflow
ðŸ¤˜ Enjoying all types of motion branding
